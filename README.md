# First-Digit-of-Powers
A python visualization of a very interesting mathematical claim a friend told me about. The distribution of first digits of powers of numbers is not uniform. In fact, it is skewed to the left towards smaller digits. Furthermore, the more we increase the power, the distribution becomes more skewed to the left, i.e. to the smaller digits.
